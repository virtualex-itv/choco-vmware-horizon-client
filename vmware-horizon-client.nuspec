	  * Fixes a performance issue with the color fidelity setting 4:4:4.
	  * Fixes a scrolling issue with dual monitors
	  ---
	  The **5.4.1** release of Horizon Client for Windows contains the following changes:
	  
	  * Fixes an issue that blocks connections to older versions of Unified Access Gateway. This issue is specific to Horizon Client for Windows installations that use the dual IPv4/IPv6 setting.
	  * Fixes an issue with SAML authentication when Workspace ONE mode is enabled on the Connection Server instance.
	  ---
	  
	  The **5.4.0** release of Horizon Client for Windows contains the following new features:
	  
	  * **Two-factor authentication after remote session timeout**
	  Beginning with Horizon 7 version 7.12, an administrator can configure two-factor authentication to occur after a remote session times out. For more information, see the VMware Horizon Console Administration document.
	  * **OPSWAT integration support**
	  You can use OPSWAT integration with Horizon Client for Windows. This feature requires Unified Access Gateway 3.9 or later. For more information, see OPSWAT Integration Requirements.
	  * **Enhancements to the selective monitor feature for published applications**
	  You can now select the monitors on which to display published application windows if you have two or more monitors. Previously, this feature required three or more monitors.
	  * **Enhancements to the Real-Time Audio-Video feature with multiple device redirection**
	  If a remote desktop supports multiple devices with the Real-Time Audio-Video feature, selecting a specific microphone in Horizon Client (**Settings > Real-Time Audio-Video > Preferred microphone**) redirects only that microphone and the selected preferred webcam to the remote desktop. You can select **All** to redirect all the available microphones and webcams to the remote desktop. For more information, see Select a Preferred Webcam or Microphone on a Windows Client System.
	  * **Changes to the useExisting URI query and a new group policy setting**
	  The default value of the useExisting URI query is changed from true to false. In addition, a new client group policy setting, **Use existing client instance when connect to same server**, is added. For more information, see Syntax for Creating vmware-view URIs and Scripting Definition Settings for Client GPOs.
