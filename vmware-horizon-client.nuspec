    <description>VMware Horizon Client for Windows makes it easy to access your Windows virtual desktop with the best possible user experience on the Local Area Network (LAN) or across a Wide Area Network (WAN). Support for Windows 10, Windows 8 and 8.1 (with Updates), and Windows 7.</description>
    <releaseNotes>
      **Note:**
      The **4.6.1** release of Horizon Client for Windows included a new command-line installation property called AUTO_UPDATE_ENABLED. This property determines whether the online update feature is enabled in Horizon Client for Windows. A value of 1 enables the feature. A value of 0 disables the feature.
      ---
      
	  The **5.3.0** release of Horizon Client for Windows contains the following new features:
	  
	  * **Battery state redirection**
	  When the Enable Battery State Redirection agent group policy setting is enabled, information about the Windows client system's battery is redirected to a Windows remote desktop. This setting is enabled by default. For more information, see the Configuring Remote Desktop Features in Horizon 7 document.
	  * **Universal Broker support**
	  You can use Horizon Client for Windows in a cloud brokering environment.
	  * **RADIUS authentication login page customization**
	  Beginning with Horizon 7 version 7.11, an administrator can customize the labels on the RADIUS authentication login page that appears in Horizon Client. For more information, see the topics about two-factor authentication in the VMware Horizon Console Administration document.
	  * **Save custom display resolution and display scaling settings on the server**
	  By default, custom display resolution and display scaling settings are stored only on the local client system. An administrator can use the Save resolution and DPI to server client group policy setting to save these settings to the server so that they are always applied, regardless of the client system that you use to log to the remote desktop. For more information, see General Settings for Client GPOs.
	  * **Windows 10 Version 1909 support**
	  You can install Horizon Client for Windows on a Windows 10 Version 1909 client system.
